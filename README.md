# seed-development-gene-prediction

This is a deep learning model implementation to predict genes that are involved in seed development in plants.

This model learns sequence based feature using and bi-LSTM feature extractor. This is done unsupervised. The extracted features along with anotated structural and protein-protein interaction network (graph) data is used to train a GCN model
